Bluemix buildpack for Swift
===========================

This is the Bluemix buildpack for Swift applications, powered by the Swift Package Manager (SPM). Though this buildpack was developed mainly for Bluemix, it can be used on any Cloud Foundry environment. This buildpack requires access to the Internet for downloading and installing several system level dependencies.

Check out the [Kitura-Starter-Bluemix](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-Starter-Bluemix) for a fully working example of a Kitura-based server application that can be deployed to Bluemix (or any Cloud Foundry environment).

```

The buildpack will detect your app as Swift if it has a `Package.swift` file in the root.

### Procfile

Using the `Procfile`, you can specify the name of executable process (e.g. `Server`) to run for your web server. Any binaries built from your Swift source using SPM will be placed in your $PATH. You can also specify any runtime parameters for your process in the `Procfile`.

```
web: Server --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```

### Swift-cfenv

Instead of specifying IP address and port values in the `Procfile` as runtime parameters to your web server process, you can instead use the [Swift-cfenv](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Swift-cfenv) package to obtain such values at runtime. The Swift-cfenv package provides structures and methods to parse Cloud Foundry-provided environment variables, such as the port number, IP address, and URL of the application. It also provides default values when running the application locally. For details on how to leverage this library in your Swift application, see the [README](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Swift-cfenv) file. When using Swift-cfenv in your app, your `Procfile` will be very simple; it will more than likely look like this:

```
web: <executable_name>
```

### What is the latest version of Swift supported?

The latest version of Swift supported by this buildpack is ```swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-05-03-a```.

### Specify a Swift version

The swift_buildpack installed on Bluemix supports the DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-05-03-a version of the Swift binaries. If you'd like to use a different version of Swift on Bluemix for your application, you'll need to specify the version with a `.swift-version` file in the root of your repository:

```shell
$ cat .swift-version
swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-04-25-a
```

In addition to including a `.swift-version` file, you'll also need to add the `-b https://github.com/IBM-Swift/swift-buildpack` parameter to the `cf push` command, as shown below:

```shell
cf push -b https://github.com/IBM-Swift/swift-buildpack
```

For a list of the Swift supported versions, check out the [manifest.yml](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/swift-buildpack/blob/bluemix-buildpack/manifest.yml) file. Since there are frequent Swift language changes, it's advised that you pin your application to a specific Swift version.

### System level libraries

This buildpack installs the following system libraries:

- libcurl3
- libblocksruntime-dev
- libkqueue0

Once Foundation (Linux) provides complete networking functionality and [`libdispatch`](#libdispatch) is bundled up with the Swift binaries, there won't be a need for installing these system libraries.

### libdispatch

As yet, the Swift binaries (for Linux) do not include the [libdispatch](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch) library. It is expected that this library will be fully integrated with the Swift binaries at some point later this year. As a stopgap solution, this buildpack includes the libdispatch binaries for the following Swift versions:

- swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-03-24-a
- swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-04-25-a
- swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-05-03-a

### Debugging

If the buildpack preparation or compilation steps are failing, you can enable some debugging using the following command:

```shell
cf set-env <app_name> BP_DEBUG true
```

To deactivate:

```shell
cf unset-env <app_name> BP_DEBUG
```

Admin tasks
-----------

To install this buildpack:
```

```

For more details on installing buildpacks, see [Adding buildpacks to Cloud Foundry](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/buildpacks.html).

Packaging
---------
The buildpack zip file provided in each release is built using `manifest-cached.yml` file:

```shell
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=cf.Gemfile bundle install
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=cf.Gemfile bundle exec buildpack-packager --cached --use-custom-manifest manifest-cached.yml
```

For details on packaging buildpacks, see [buildpack-packager](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/buildpack-packager).
